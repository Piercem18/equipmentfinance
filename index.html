    <div class="loan card">
        <h2>Loan</h2>
        <p class="description">A loan is a flexible financing solution that not only allows you to access modern equipment but also grants ownership, along with the potential deductions of loan interest and equipment depreciation from taxable income, enhancing cost-effectiveness.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="lease card">
        <h2>Lease</h2>
        <p class="description">A lease is a cost-effective financing option that offers preserved cash flow and potential tax benefits through deductible lease payments and depreciation write-offs. Both Operational and Capital leases available.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Refinancing card">
        <h2>Refinance</h2>
        <p class="description">Refinancing involves strategic options like leasing equipment shortly after purchase or selling to a lender and leasing back, which can unlock cash tied up in assets and provide flexibility for reinvestment, all while potentially benefiting from lower interest rates.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="interim card">
        <h2>Interim Funding Option</h2>
        <p class="description">Interim funding, such as a gap loan, is a unique solution common in manufacturing, where clients start making payments only on interest even before the equipment is shipped, with the financing converting into a lease once installed. </p>

    <h1 >Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p class="description"><b>What credit score is needed?</b><br><br>Typically, our clients have a personal credit score of 550 or higher. If your credit score falls below 550, we may request additional information to carefully assess and potentially approve your credit application. We are committed to finding solutions that work for you.</p>
    <p class="description"><b>Will this affect my credit?</b><br><br>We conduct a soft credit inquiry to determine the programs you may be eligible for, and it's important to note that a soft pull will not affect your credit score. At Vital Capital, we take into account both your personal and business credit when evaluating your credit application. Rest assured, we consider the full picture to find the right solutions for you</p>
    <p class="description"><b>What is required for submission?</b><br><br>We will guide you through the process of completing a credit application, which we'll provide, along with the submission of a valid ID. During our initial phone call, we will provide step-by-step assistance in gathering the necessary information from you.</p>
    <p class="description"><b>How long does approval and funding take?</b><br><br>Funding can be as swift as 24 hours. The exact timing may vary due to the volume of requests, but what sets us apart from our competitors is our strong focus on getting your business needs met as quickly as possible.</p>
